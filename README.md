minigames
=========

A small Corona SDK project submitted as an assignment - three mini-games which demonstrate Corona techniques learned in a Mobile Development module of WebElevate, a Diploma in Digital Media in the Digital Skills Academy, Dublin.

Included are all source files, images, audio files, a copy of the assignment brief and the minigames.apk compiled for deployment on Android 2.2+.

Sample images of the game menu and each mini-game are available on:
